When is a person most productive? It is when they are driven by the deadline!This book is born out of a two week game jam, a collaborative event in which people would form teams to make a game from scratch. The jam happened in March 2023, out of which 60 games were born, 25 are catalogued in this book. Among these games, many are video games, but there are other genres too, such as tabletop boardgames, cutout poetry-making game, role playing games and even an NFT game. For over half of the developers, this was their first endeavour in making games.Just like the sweetest jam, this book demands more than just idle reading for an entertaining experience. Prepare to wield scissors and make some cunning cuts as you peruse these pages, or roll up your sleeves and embark on a DIY board game adventure. And if you seek tranquility, find a quiet corner to indulge in the sublime delights of mindful gaming. Get ready to jam, my dear reader, in ways you never thought possible!

正如每个人都可以做自己的游戏，每个人也可以做自己的书。

这本书的页面花里胡哨，让人不明就里。它的主要内容是25个游戏的介绍，设计由创作者本人提供。这些游戏均诞生于二十面体、落日间和A4美术馆联合发起的**人工自然Game Jam**。

14天的时间里，上百位游戏创作者围绕“人工自然”的主题提交了60个游戏，而其中的25个游戏创作者，又用了14天的时间，把他们的游戏用“纸”呈现出来。

这些游戏涵盖了电子游戏、桌游、身体游戏、装置行为、互动媒体、还有很多无法描述的游戏… 在做书的过程中，创作者们又利用纸的特性，创造了新的互动可能。

书籍使用环扣装订，读者可以自行订起、解下、抽取其中的游戏来游玩。
