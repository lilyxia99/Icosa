When is a person most productive? It is when they are driven by the deadline!This book is born out of a two week game jam, a collaborative event in which people would form teams to make a game from scratch. The jam happened in March 2023, out of which 60 games were born, 25 are catalogued in this book. Among these games, many are video games, but there are other genres too, such as tabletop boardgames, cutout poetry-making game, role playing games and even an NFT game. For over half of the developers, this was their first endeavour in making games.Just like the sweetest jam, this book demands more than just idle reading for an entertaining experience. Prepare to wield scissors and make some cunning cuts as you peruse these pages, or roll up your sleeves and embark on a DIY board game adventure. And if you seek tranquility, find a quiet corner to indulge in the sublime delights of mindful gaming. Get ready to jam, my dear reader, in ways you never thought possible!
