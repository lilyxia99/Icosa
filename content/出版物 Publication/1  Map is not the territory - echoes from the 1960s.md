The third edition of the Icosa Magazine is themed the map is not the territory. It begins with the search for the historical underpinnings of the countercultural magazine the Whole Earth Catalog, which turns out to have significant contemporary resonances with China of today. We invited some 50 people to join an online workshop lasting eight weeks to learn about the history of the WEC and its later developments. What is the inquiry that drive the search for alternative lifestyle, in the 1960s and in today? That is the question that we want to find answers to with this special edition.

This set of posters is the product of a 2.5-month online workshop titled "**[[Returning to the WEC|Return to the Global Overview Site]]**" initiated by the Icosa Magazine and Inspiration Buyers Club in March 2021. 50 participants engaged in reading, investigating, researching, and discussing the book "Whole Earth Catalog", a tool book spanning half a century. The entire process is documented at http://2021.accessto.tools/. The editing, design, content, production, and even folding and packaging of the posters were jointly completed by the workshop members.

The posters feature 17 selected theme presentations from the workshop. The content is also a collection of the pictures, links, and tool information shared by the presenters on the workshop website. These text and link information "tofu blocks" form the main body of the posters.

On the other side of the posters, excerpts and translations of the tool recommendations from each subsection of the 1971 edition of the "Last Whole Earth Catalog" are presented.
