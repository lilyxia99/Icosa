The third edition of the Icosa Magazine is themed the map is not the territory. It begins with the search for the historical underpinnings of the countercultural magazine the Whole Earth Catalog, which turns out to have significant contemporary resonances with China of today. We invited some 50 people to join an online workshop lasting eight weeks to learn about the history of the WEC and its later developments. What is the inquiry that drive the search for alternative lifestyle, in the 1960s and in today? That is the question that we want to find answers to with this special edition.
