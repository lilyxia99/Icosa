**2023 book, screw binding CNY 78**

Half a century ago, when computer animation first started to emerge, it would take a whole week to complete just a few seconds of animation by computer. Today, thanks to the development of AI technology, if you have a decent computer, you can use AI technology to produce extremely realistic images and animations in just a few seconds.The development of technology has opened up new possibilities for film and television creation, but it has also given rise to a new set of problems. In January 2023, the Icosa Magazine held a workshop on the theme of "The Ghost in the Machine", inviting more than ten enthusiasts interested in this topic to discuss and create. The group spent three weeks learning about different AI technologies and applying them to their own work. This booklet is a record of this exploration.In this handbook, an array of tools used in the field of film and television creation, ranging from pre-production scripting to post-production visual effects generation, are introduced. It also contains an article by Leilei Xia on some of the ethical challenges posed by the use of AI technology. A review piece by film critic Gene Youngblood from the early 1980s on the use of computers in film creation, and an essay by mathematician Claude Berge from the 1960s on the potential of combinatorial literature, are reprinted as well. The book ends with an appendix where we introduce readers to the ten short films born out of the filmmaking workshop.
