The 1960s in the United States was a time of passion and innovation. Under the shadow of the Vietnam War, there were waves of anti-war, anti-mainstream culture, anti-racism, environmental movement, sexual liberation and gender equality. After the Summer of Love in 1967, the hippie movement entered a new phase. Singing songs of love and peace, they left the cities and formed communities in the countryside, living in self-sufficiency and communalism, searching for personal liberation and spiritual awakening. 1969 was considered the "Year of the Commune," when more than 500 communes were started across the U.S. 

After breaking away from the system, they became self-sufficient, living in communal harmony. How to live a self-sufficient life after leaving the system? This was the question facing the hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog was born in 1968. It is a catalog that introduces the world from the perspective of individual needs and through the recommendation of tools. The first edition of the catalog was divided into seven categories: "Understanding the Whole System," "Homes and Dwellings," "Industries and Crafts," "Communications and Exchange," and "Communication. Communication and Exchange", "Community", "Traveling", and "Learning". It covers Buckminster Fuller's architectural philosophy, John Cage's music, how to build a house, how to build a personal computer, the Merck Homeopathic Diagnostic Manual, dolphin awareness, beekeeping techniques, book making techniques, wilderness survival, meditation, fishing, outdoor gear, solar power, the I Ching, Indian Yoga, and more. ...... has everything you need. It was a huge hit when it came out, and was hailed as the hippie bible, deeply involved in and influential in the counterculture movement. It is not as specialized as an encyclopedia, but every tool in the book is introduced by someone who has actually used it, and more than 70% of the content comes from readers' submissions. The introduction of the tools is extremely subjective, but this is precisely what makes the book most appealing. 

In 2021, Icosahedron and the Inspired Buyer's Club launched a "Return to the Global Overview" to re-explore this maze of treasures with other people who have been deeply influenced by and still have an interest in the Global Overview. 

Each of the 50 participants received a photocopy of one or two chapters of the Last Whole Earth Catalog 1971, depending on their interests. Each week a topic was investigated and discussed according to the chapters of the first edition of the Global Survey. Participants who have been given a copy of the corresponding chapter will be asked to participate (as much as possible) in that week's seminar. Any participant can download and print the electronic version of the Global Survey and listen to or participate in each week's discussion. 

The research portion is conducted asynchronously on http://2021.accessto.tools/, and the discussion is focused on Sunday evenings and typically lasts 4-5 hours. The first half hour is an introduction to the chapter by Tony Yet, followed by an hour to an hour and a half of voluntary sharing by the participants on the topic, which is the main part of "Maps are not frontiers". The next 2-3 hours were spent in scattered discussions and small talk until everyone was gone and the evening's tea party automatically ended.
