Time-limited game development challenges (Game Jams) are pioneering creative activities deeply rooted in the independent game community, but they are also the initial starting point for many game creators to get involved in game development. Over the past two decades, Game Jam activities have been open to a wide range of people and have taken root around the world, creating closely connected communities. We are not so limited to the context of indie games, but rather open up a broader imagination of games, finding a delicate balance between openness and closure, breadth and depth, research and improvisation, and between video games as a new medium and the not-so-young "contemporary art."

This event is jointly initiated by Icosa Magazine, Sunset Interval, and A4AB. The works created will be brought to the A4AB Art Book Exhibition at the A4 Art Museum in Chengdu, allowing more people to experience them.

A total of 60 works were created in this Game Jam, all of which can be played and experienced at https://itch.io/jam/artificial-nature.

限时游戏开发挑战（Game Jam）是一种深深植根于独立游戏社群的先锋创作活动，但同时也是许多游戏制作者接触游戏制作的最初起点。Game Jam 活动发展的二十多年来，为众多人群开放，并在全世界各地生根发芽，创造出紧密连接的社群。我们不那么局限在独立游戏的语境下，去打开更为广阔的游戏想象，找到在开放与封闭，广度与深度，研究思考与即兴创作，以及作为新媒体的电子游戏与不那么年轻的「当代艺术」之间的微妙平衡。

这次活动由二十面体、落日间、A4AB联合发起，大家的作品将会被带到成都A4美术馆的A4AB艺术书展上让更多人能够体验。

本次Game Jam共有60个作品诞生，均可在 https://itch.io/jam/artificial-nature 上游玩体验。
