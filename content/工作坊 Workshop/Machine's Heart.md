Ling's Fifth Time-Limited Image Creation Game

Theme: The Heart of the Machine

Participants: Xia Leilei, Liko, Jingwei, Haixin, He Shan, Zhang Jiuwo, Tony Yet

Time: January 6-27, 2023

Ling is a small group of amateurs engaged in video creation and learning, located in an offline space inside the Huangpu Shipyard on Changzhou Island, Guangzhou. It is also the location of the Icosa Magazine Reading Room.

Since October 2022, Ling has organized 5 time-limited image creation workshops. The themes of the first 4 workshops were "Changzhou Island Hair Salon," "Xia Yixuan's Workbook," "Mysterious Visitor," and "Superstition."

From January 6 to 27, a total of 21 days (January 15 is the submission deadline for the AIFF\* Film Festival short films, which can be chosen as one's own deadline), participants will create short films around the theme of "The Heart of the Machine," including but not limited to: collaborating with AI to generate content, using new technologies, gamified methods, algorithmic logic, etc., to shoot short films. The short films can be fiction, educational, documentary, games, and more.

This Ling workshop has also been adjusted to a semi-public online format, with many new friends joining the early learning and discussions.

As a learning-oriented workshop, we have also created an online playground for everyone to share their exploration and learning experiences. In addition to the films, this process of learning and research is also very important.

During the 21-day workshop, a total of 10 short films were produced. They can be viewed online.

Ling的第五次限时影像创作游戏

主题：机器之心

参与者：夏磊蕾、立刻、经纬、海辛、何珊、张久我、Tony Yet

时间：2023年1月6日-27日

Ling 是一群由业余者构成的影视创作和学习小组，一个位于广州市长洲岛黄埔造船厂内的线下空间。也是二十面体阅览室所在地。

从2022年10月开始，Ling陆续组织了5次限时创作影像工作坊。前4次的主题分别为“长洲岛发廊”、“夏颐萱的作业本”、“神秘访客”、“迷信”。

1.6-1.27，共21天（1.15是AIFF*电影节短片提交截止日期，可自主选择是否作为自己的ddl）围绕“机器之心”这个主题进行短片创作，包括但不限于：和AI合作生成内容，利用新技术、游戏化的方式、算法的逻辑等等去拍短片。短片可以是剧情片、科教片、纪录片、游戏……

本期 Ling 的工作坊也相应调整为线上半公开的形式，有许多新的朋友加入前期的学习和讨论中。

作为一次学习型工作坊，我们也开辟了一个线上的 playground 让大家分享自己的探索和学习经历。除了影片以外，这样的学习和调研的过程也是很重要的。

在21天的工作坊中一共产出了10部短片。可在线上观看。
