_红色和黑色是中国大陆能买到的二手 RISO 机器上，原配的滚筒对应的两种颜色，也是最容易买到的国产替代油墨里最常见的两种颜色。这个颜色的使用习惯(当然还要加上蓝色)，从油印机时代就开始形成：从油印的黑白传单，到 60-70 年代因最容易找到红黑两色油墨而做成的文革小报，再到 80-90 年代或手工誊写或打字机敲出的蜡纸印出来的黑色 / 蓝色通知和试卷…… RISO(即理想公司出品的此类数字孔版印刷机)这种技术沿着 80年代后沿海城市的技术引进及某种地域所对应的行业垄断——本地化堪用的替代性耗材和配件、二手便宜的机器就是这么来的——进入到我们的视野，开始继续印试卷、 印六合__彩广告......这就是我们日常生活的构件里最可见的视觉部分，红色和黑色。_ 

_—— 子杰（复印info）_

_Red and black are the two colors that correspond to the original rollers on second-hand RISO machines available in mainland China, and they are also the two most common colors in the most readily available domestically produced replacement inks. The habit of using this color (plus blue, of course) has been formed since the days of mimeographs: from black and white flyers printed in mimeographs, to the Cultural Revolution tabloids of the 60s and 70s, where red and black ink were the easiest to find, to the black/blue notices and test papers of the 80s and 90s, which were either hand-transcribed or typewritten on waxed paper... ... the technology of the RISO (i.e. such digital perforated printing presses from RISO), along with the introduction of the technology in the coastal cities of the post-1980s and a sort of geographic monopoly of the industry - localized and available alternative consumables and accessories, second-hand cheap machines - came into view -entered the scene and began to print test papers and six-color advertisements ....... These are the most visible visual parts of the building blocks of our daily lives, the colors red and black. _

小河在操作子杰的riso机器‍‍‍‍‍‍

这诸多零杂的作品合集，可以被看作是一个小型的展览。但不是光用眼睛看就行，需要上手玩才能理解其中的奥妙。可以随时随地分享给朋友，还可以复制、分发、再创造里面的内容（在遵守作者的知识共享协议约定前提下）。  

这样的便携式低成本展览得以发生，完完全全是多亏了每一位读者/创作者的支持。每一期的收支都会在编辑部后台列明。新年第一期我们就超支了，所以我们打算继续销售50套邮包和2024年挂历。

Shan operating Zijie's riso machine‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍

This collection of many scattered works can be seen as a small exhibition. But it's not just a matter of looking at it with your eyes, you need to get your hands on it and play with it in order to understand the wonders of it. It can be shared with friends anywhere, anytime, and the contents can be copied, distributed, and recreated (subject to the author's Creative Commons agreement).  

Such a portable, low-cost exhibition can only happen thanks to the support of every reader/creator. Each issue's income and expenses are listed in the editorial back office. We overspent on the first issue of the new year, so we're going to go ahead and sell 50 mailers and the 2024 wall calendar.

**岩湾甲巷乙号** **Yam Wan A Lane No. B **

岩湾甲巷乙号是我老家住处的地址。小学时我们家在这块地皮上盖了一栋楼房，我在这儿住到17岁上大学。小我 9 岁的弟弟在这里出生，也一直住到他出去上大学。

现在我和弟弟在其他省份工作上学，岩湾甲巷乙号这个家在任何层面都上变得飘忽起来，我们对它的记忆也是。两人凭印象画出那里的客厅、餐厅、卧室，整体户型一样，而细节相似又有差异。我们在同一个家里度过不同的时间，记下不同的细节，正如双色的 riso 油墨并不精确地叠印在纸面上。

但这些概念和比喻都不是最重要的。重要的是我和弟弟在这里一起度过了我们的童年和青少年，那些在纸上一边重叠一边偏差着的空间和物品，只有我们两人知道它们的意义，也只有我们两人能这样去画。

No. B, A Lane, Rock Bay is the address of my old family residence. When I was in elementary school, my family built a building on this plot of land, and I lived here until I was 17 years old and went to college. My younger brother, who is 9 years old, was born here and lived here until he went away to university.

Now that my brother and I are working and going to school in other provinces, the home of No. B, A Lane, Iwawan, has drifted away on every level, and so have our memories of it. The two of us drew the living room, dining room, and bedrooms there from our impressions; the overall floor plan was the same, while the details were similar and different. We spend different amounts of time in the same home, jotting down different details, just as the two-color riso ink does not precisely overprint the paper.

But these concepts and metaphors are not the most important. What matters is that my brother and I spent our childhood and adolescence here together, and that the spaces and objects that deviate while overlapping on the paper are the only two people who know what they mean, and the only two people who can draw like that.

两块距骨骰，一张神谕书。

骨头涂成红与黑，神谕书折成投掷盒。

https://shimo.im/boards/N2A1gDBlYOu47KqD

红色象征疯狂，黑色象征恐惧

一人游戏，你是一位求卜者。你需要避开疯狂与恐惧，求得神谕。

两人游戏，你们是疯狂与恐惧的化身，毁灭的两极，操纵求卜者的距骨骰，把他一步一步拉入你的深渊。

Two talus dice, one oracle book.

The bones are painted red and black, and the oracle book is folded into a throw box.

https://shimo.im/boards/N2A1gDBlYOu47KqD

Red symbolizes madness, black symbolizes fear

A one-player game where you are an oracle seeker. You need to avoid madness and fear and seek the oracle.

For a two-player game, you are the embodiment of madness and fear, the poles of destruction, manipulating the seeker's talus dice and pulling him step by step into your abyss.
  

**一次红与黑的色彩文字漫游** **A colorful text romp through red and black**

在颜色用RGB或者CMYK标定在屏幕或印刷品之前，它们是用文字来交流传达的。

第一个探索，是将一些短诗印在不同的红/黑比例的颜色上。随着颜色的加深，文字本身所浸染的情绪似乎也开始逐渐沉重。

第二个探索，是对古汉语有关”红与黑“的文字进行了调查，发现了许多已经丢失的颜色文字，并顺着找到了与之相关的小故事。

第三个探索，是虚构颜色汉字。在一张可以对折的卡片上，印制了一副图像，一个仿甲骨文的汉字，以及一段文字：有对话、判词、声音诗、寓言、文字图像、短句、歌谣等等。根据文字所透露的信息、所呈现的状态，以及图像的暗示，传递出汉字所代表的特定颜色。

Before colors were calibrated in RGB or CMYK on screen or in print, they were communicated conveyed in words.

The first exploration of this was to print a number of short poems in different red/black ratios of color. As the color deepens, the mood imbued in the text itself seems to start getting heavier.

The second exploration was to investigate the ancient Chinese words for “red and black”, discovering many lost color words and finding related short stories along the way.

The third exploration was to create fictional color characters. On a card that can be folded in half, an image, a kanji imitating an oracle bone script, and a text are printed: dialogues, judgments, sound poems, fables, word images, phrases, ballads, and so on. Depending on what the text reveals, what state it is in, and what the image suggests, the particular color represented by the Chinese character is conveyed.

**编织封皮**

在尽量保持黑红方块数量一致的情况下，安排黑红方块位置交换以显示出文字。在绘制过程中我注意力集中，体会到编织逻辑中具有的数学性。如此构成的像素风格的编织纹，也使得文字被模糊，成为更加图案化的装饰。  

While trying to keep the number of black and red squares the same, the black and red squares are arranged to swap positions to show the text. I focused my attention during the drawing process to realize the mathematical nature of the weaving logic. The pixelated style of the weaving pattern thus composed also allows the text to be blurred and become a more patterned decoration.

**红与黑剧本**

 张久我

最早在看红与黑这个题目的时候想到的是AC米兰的队服，我的俱乐部主队，但是在真正要开始创作的那会儿，沉迷于赌博，红与黑对我来说，就是扑克牌的颜色。几个月来我们玩过很多次德扑，试探/博弈/心跳/上脑，听说这跟恋爱的感觉很相似。这期我写了一个小品式的剧本，原本有机会拍出来的，但拍摄还是要比我们想象中的难啊。

The first thing that came to mind when I was looking at the title Red and Black was the AC Milan uniforms, my club's home team, but at the moment when I really had to start working on it, being addicted to gambling, red and black were the colors of poker for me. We played derby many times over the months, testing/gaming/heartbeat/upper-brain, which I've heard is similar to falling in love. I wrote a skit-style script for this issue and had a chance to film it, but filming is still going to be harder than we thought it was going to be.
