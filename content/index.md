二十面体是一个独立研究&独立出版小组，聚集了一批关注数学和艺术的艺术家和研究者，每一个项目都是花一段时间做一个集体研究或创作，然后通过出版物的方式和更多人分享研究及创作。研究及相关出版物的主题涵盖：埃舍尔及镶嵌画、法国文学团体乌力波、Whole earth Catalog 及嬉皮士运动、触、扑克骰子游戏系统、材料游戏…… 每一个项目根据话题的特殊性，参与者从10人到100人不等。大部分的协作都是线上的，我们根据话题来选择合适的协作平台，这个研究和创作的内容都尽量是在尊重每一个参与者意愿的前提下开源的，他的过程也是可见的。

我们想要推动一种alternative way of 知识的产生、以及基于信任和鼓励，而非评价与竞争的研究和创作环境。

Icosa Magazine is an independent research & independent publication group that brings together a group of artists and researchers concerned with math and art. Each project is a collective research or creation that takes a period of time to do, and then the research and creation is shared with a wider audience through publications. Topics of research and related publications range from Escher and mosaics, the French literary group Oulipo, the Whole earth Catalog and the hippy movement, touch, poker dice gaming systems, and material games ...... Each project ranges from 10 to 100 participants, depending on the specificity of the topic. Most of the collaborations are online, we choose the right collaboration platform according to the topic, and this research and creation is as open source as possible respecting the wishes of each participant and his process is visible.

We want to promote an alternative way of knowledge generation, and a research and creation environment based on trust and encouragement rather than evaluation and competition.
